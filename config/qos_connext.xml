<!-- 
RTI Connext DDS User QoS Profiles

This document is intended to be used to extend the builtin QoS profiles if 
desired. Each of the builtin profiles, other than the Baseline.x.x.x 
profiles, has a counterpart in this file named User.X, where X is the profile 
that it is inheriting from. 

All of the built-in profiles can be found in the 
BuiltinProfiles.documentationONLY.xml file located in the
$NDDSHOME/resource/xml/ directory. 

In order to have the profiles in this file automatically loaded into your
application you should keep this file in the same location, but rename it to
NDDS_QOS_PROFILES.xml. You will then be able to refer to these profiles by name
in your application.
